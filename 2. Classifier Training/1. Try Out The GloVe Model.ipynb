I submitted proof that my social security number, fingerprints, birthdate, addresses, and other identifying information were affected by the XXXX XXXX data breach as well as XXXX 's XXXX data breach. I submitted all the required documents per 15usc1681c and yet the CRA has failed to block this information and it has been over 4 days. Again, this is NOT A DISPUTE.   \n",

The reporting year is also inaccurate causing the two accounts to appear on report beyond statute of limitations which would end XX/XX/XXXX not XX/XX/XXXX. I was not given any results or verification of debt after any of the disputes. There is a dispute statement listed which I did not provide.   \n",

The account was placed with HUNTER WARFIELD during XXXX and now has a balance of {$14000.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX. This is due to additional junk fees being added to the collection over a period five years ( XXXX ). \\n\\nI have disputed the account several times to only have the adjusted to satisfy the dispute and readjusted and reported back on my credit report after a few months with amounts that differ from the original balance and higher then the previous amounts reported. This is a predatory action by the debt collector which does the greatest amount of damage to my credit report and credit rating on a closed account.   \n",

I have paid some charges directly to the US Department of Veterns Affairs and they are very slow in applying money to the proper accounts. Their billing system is very slow. And then when I receive statements from CBE there is no reference to which VA billing statement these charges apply. \\nI am still paying VA invoices that I receive for medications and office visits. How do I know if I am double paying my charges? This is unacceptable.

    "##### We dont remove stop words,  perform lemmatization or stemmingfor GloVe\n",
    "Context: GloVe vectors capture the context of words by considering their co-occurrences with other words. Removing stopwords might lead to loss of some context, especially for tasks where the semantics of the full sentence are important. For instance, in sentiment analysis, removing stopwords could potentially alter the sentiment of a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Semantic Meaning: Some stopwords carry semantic meaning. For instance, the word \"not\" is generally considered a stopword, but it is also a negation word that can completely reverse the meaning of a sentence. If you remove it, you might change the meaning of your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Word Frequency: GloVe vectors are trained on a corpus where the stopwords are usually not removed. As a result, the embeddings for these words can capture useful semantic and syntactic relationships because of their high frequency of occurrence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dimensionality: On the other hand, removing stopwords can help in reducing the dimensionality of your data and might make your model faster and more efficient, especially if you have a very large corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Lemmatization and stemming are techniques used to reduce words to their root form. These techniques can be useful for certain tasks where you want to treat different inflections of a word (like \"run\", \"running\", \"runs\") as the same word. However, when using pre-trained word embeddings like GloVe, you should be aware that the embeddings for the original words and their stemmed/lemmatized versions are not the same, and in some cases, the stemmed/lemmatized version might not even be in the vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, lemmatization and stemming can sometimes change the meaning of the word or make it lose its context. For instance, the word \"meeting\" can be a verb (as in \"I am meeting my friends\") or a noun (as in \"I have a meeting\"). If you stem it to \"meet\", it might lose this contextual information."

This was not a dispute, however, the FCRA has chosen to forgo XXXX regulation and apply their company policy to treat this as a dispute. In fact, when I called them, they stated that their policy supersedes XXXX law ( which states ) ( a ) Block A consumer reporting agency should block the reporting of any information in the file of a consumer that the consumer identifies as information that resulted from alleged identity theft, not later than 4 business days after the date receipt by such agency of- ( 1 ) appropriate proof of the identity of the consumer ; ( 2 ) a copy of an identity theft report, ( 3 ) the identification of such information by the consumer, and ( 4 ) a statement by the consumer that the information is not information relating to any transaction by the consumer. I submitted proof that my social security number, fingerprints, birthdate, addresses, and other identifying information were affected by the XXXX XXXX data breach as well as XXXX 's XXXX data breach. I submitted all the required documents per 15usc1681c and yet the CRA has failed to block this information and it has been over 4 days. Again, this is NOT A DISPUTE.   \n",

The account was placed with HUNTER WARFIELD during XXXX and now has a balance of {$14000.00} as of XX/XX/XXXX. This is due to additional junk fees being added to the collection over a period five years ( XXXX ). \\n\\nI have disputed the account several times to only have the adjusted to satisfy the dispute and readjusted and reported back on my credit report after a few months with amounts that differ from the original balance and higher then the previous amounts reported.

Provide me with documentation that I am legally obligated to pay them. They did not. I asked them to Cease & Deists Communication in reference to the collection of this debt on all mediums including to any non-affiliated third parties. They did not. There was NEVER permissible permission given for anyone to share my private nonpublic information. No consent is identity theft. \\nAlso, as defined by the IRS -Even if you don't receive a 1099C, you must report cancelled debt as gross income on your tax return. \\nThe IRS clearly defines a charge off as Gross or Ordinary income. \\nINCOME DOES NOT GET REPORTED ON THE CONSUMER REPORT!! \\nGRAIN TECHNOLOGY is reporting an account is C/O on my consumer report they SHOULD NOT. \\nDelete this account IMEDIATELY!!!   \n",
