A day or two after, there was a second attempt, this time for {$8000.00} ( from the new account ), thanks to the security features that I had put in place, I was able to reject the transaction. \\nI submitted a sworn affidavit to Chase Claims Department. A temporary credit was issued to my account ; however, it was reversed on XX/XX/XXXX. Chase claims that their Claims Dept. has disputed the transaction twice and that XXXX has reaffirmed the transaction. I spoke to a XXXX representative on XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX 's and was transferred to the Fraud Department. I was then confirmed that there was an account under my name. I was requested to submit a picture of my driver 's license, via email, to confirm my identity, I was told that an unauthorized individual, using my social security, and personal information, opened an account under my name. XXXX confirmed that the funds were still there, distributed between an equity account and a futures account. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a telephone call from a XXXX representative who claimed that in order to return the funds to my account, Chase had to recall the ACH transaction. I have gone multiple times to the Chase local branch and the branch doesn't have the ability to recall the funds. They said the recall of the transaction is done at the claims department. The claims department however, doesn't do recalls of ACH transactions. Instead, they dispute the ACH transactions, but since there is an existing account under my name at XXXX, they continue reaffirming the transaction. \\nI have requested XXXX to return the stolen funds to my Chase business account without success. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I sent a demand letter ( via email ) requesting the refund of those funds be returned to my Chase account. Even though XXXX acknowledged my email, they haven't call me nor contact me in any way. \\nIn addition, my claim to Chase was escalated to the Executive Office since XX/XX/XXXX. It is been a week already and still Chase has not returned the stolen funds back to my account. \\nBoth XXXX and Chase know that I have been a victim of identity theft.\\n\\nI have been a client at Chase since I opened my business in XXXX. In order to do an ACH transaction, the accountholder has to be enrolled in ACH Payment Services. I have never enrolled my business in the ACH Payment Services and there is no record of my business ever making any payments using the ACH features. \\nI am a small business owner with limited resources. I have wasted time and effort trying to get this resolved in good faith. I have contacted both institutions, I have spend countless hours either in person, at the branch, or by phone. I have neglected my business operations trying to get both institutions to work together and return the money stolen from my business. The complete disregard that both institutions have shown is uncalled for.</td>\n",

       "97  On XX/XX/XXXX an unauthorized transaction for {$30000.00} was made from my business account at Chase Bank to a XXXX account that was opened under my name by an unauthorized individual. \\nAfter I discovered the fraudulent ACH debit, I reported it to Chase immediately and filed a police report. with the XXXX XXXX Police Department XXXX XXXX XXXX. \\nI closed the Chase account from where the funds were stolen, opened a new account, changed my login and password information and implemented security features. A day or two after, there was a second attempt, this time for {$8000.00} ( from the new account ), thanks to the security features that I had put in place, I was able to reject the transaction. \\nI submitted a sworn affidavit to Chase Claims Department. A temporary credit was issued to my account ; however, it was reversed on XX/XX/XXXX. Chase claims that their Claims Dept. has disputed the transaction twice and that XXXX has reaffirmed the transaction. I spoke to a XXXX representative on XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX 's and was transferred to the Fraud Department. I was then confirmed that there was an account under my name. I was requested to submit a picture of my driver 's license, via email, to confirm my identity, I was told that an unauthorized individual, using my social security, and personal information, opened an account under my name. XXXX confirmed that the funds were still there, distributed between an equity account and a futures account. On XX/XX/XXXX I received a telephone call from a XXXX representative who claimed that in order to return the funds to my account, Chase had to recall the ACH transaction. I have gone multiple times to the Chase local branch and the branch doesn't have the ability to recall the funds. They said the recall of the transaction is done at the claims department. The claims department however, doesn't do recalls of ACH transactions. Instead, they dispute the ACH transactions, but since there is an existing account under my name at XXXX, they continue reaffirming the transaction. \\nI have requested XXXX to return the stolen funds to my Chase business account without success. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I sent a demand letter ( via email ) requesting the refund of those funds be returned to my Chase account. Even though XXXX acknowledged my email, they haven't call me nor contact me in any way. \\nIn addition, my claim to Chase was escalated to the Executive Office since XX/XX/XXXX. It is been a week already and still Chase has not returned the stolen funds back to my account. \\nBoth XXXX and Chase know that I have been a victim of identity theft.\\n\\nI have been a client at Chase since I opened my business in XXXX. In order to do an ACH transaction, the accountholder has to be enrolled in ACH Payment Services. I have never enrolled my business in the ACH Payment Services and there is no record of my business ever making any payments using the ACH features. \\nI am a small business owner with limited resources. I have wasted time and effort trying to get this resolved in good faith. I have contacted both institutions, I have spend countless hours either in person, at the branch, or by phone. I have neglected my business operations trying to get both institutions to work together and return the money stolen from my business. The complete disregard that both institutions have shown is uncalled for.   \n",
